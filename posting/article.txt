A coup d'état in Myanmar began on the morning of 1 February 2021, when democratically elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's military, which then vested power in a military junta. Acting President of Myanmar Myint Swe proclaimed a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been transferred to Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of the November 2020 general election invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency.[10][11] The coup d'état occurred the day before the Parliament of Myanmar was to swear in the members elected in the 2020 election, thereby preventing this from occurring.[12][13][14] President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi were detained, along with ministers, their deputies, and members of Parliament.[15][16]

On 1 February 2021, Win Myint and Aung San Suu Kyi were arrested on charges that independent analysts regarded as part of an attempt to legitimize the military's seizure of power.[17][18] Both were remanded in custody for two weeks.[19][20][21] Between 16 February and 1 April, five additional charges were leveled against Aung San Suu Kyi.[22][23][24]

Armed insurgencies by the People's Defence Force of the National Unity Government erupted throughout Myanmar in response to the military government's crackdown on anti-coup protests.[25]

As of 13 March 2024, at least 50,000 people,[26] including at least 8,000 civilians (570 of whom were children),[27][28] have been killed by the junta forces and 26,234 individuals have been arrested.[29][30][31] In March 2021, three prominent members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) died in police custody,[32][33] and in July 2022, the junta executed four pro-democracy activists.[34]

In honour of the anniversary for Myanmar's 76th year of independence in January 2024, more than 9,000 prisoners are slated to receive amnesty, leading to their release from prison.[35]
