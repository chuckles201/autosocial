Autosocial: The Savage Future of Cross-Platform Content Distribution

Whoa, just stumbled upon this lit project called "Autosocial" that's about to make your social media game absolutely savage! This tool automatically posts your content across multiple platforms while using a finetuned LLM to craft platform-specific titles and descriptions that are totally lit for each audience.

The project breaks down into three savage parts:

1. Posting Mechanism: It's identifying the API requirements and format expectations for platforms like Hackernews, Reddit, X, Medium, and Discord (with YouTube and Instagram on the roadmap). The savage efficiency here is unmatched.

2. LLM Integration: The lit core of the system uses an LLM with custom instructions to generate platform-optimized descriptions. The GUI allows you to feed in your content and let the savage AI work its magic before distributing across platforms.

3. Metrics Tracking: Perhaps the most lit feature is the automated tracking dashboard that aggregates performance metrics across platforms. It even suggests cross-linking between platforms to create a savage ecosystem for your content.
